The hypothetical application of my team is coded with Python. With Python, it is easy to use Pylint as a linter. Pylint not only finds errors and code smells, but it can also make suggestions about refactoring the code. Covering new functions with automated unit tests helps find bugs and prevents breaking the code. Unittest and Pytest libraries are useful for that. The code can be compiled and built with CPython. CPython offers a pydebug build that helps with catching issues. For setting up our CI pipeline, we use CircleCI and a Docker container. For CircleCI, we need a configuration file that contains instructions for all the steps that the build server needs. For our application, CircleCI is efficient as it can be set up within minutes and as one of the world’s most popular CI/CD platforms, it’s reliable. It’s less customizable than Jenkins, but in our case that doesn’t cause problems. We could also use a self-hosted Python package repository like Devpi for small and easy projects with a small team like ours, or Artifactory for larger projects, advanced access control and security features, but we might need more technical expertise and ongoing maintenance for self-hosting. Our application is quite small, and it doesn’t have any special requirements, which is why cloud-hosted environment is the easiest option.
